This guide will help you understand the fundamentals of TypeScript and how to integrate it into your projects.</p><h2>Why TypeScript?</h2><p>TypeScript adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. It helps catch errors early in development and improves code quality.</p><h2>Basic Types</h2><p>TypeScript supports several basic types including string, number, boolean, array, tuple, enum, and more. Understanding these types is crucial for effective TypeScript development.</p>",

Unlike traditional keyword-based search, semantic search understands the meaning behind queries.</p><h2>What is Semantic Search?</h2><p>Semantic search uses machine learning to understand the intent and contextual meaning of search queries. It goes beyond simple keyword matching to find truly relevant results.</p><h2>Vector Embeddings</h2><p>The key to semantic search is converting text into vector embeddings - numerical representations that capture semantic meaning. Similar concepts have similar vectors.</p>",
